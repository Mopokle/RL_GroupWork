# ü§ñ RL_GroupWork

This is a reinforcement learning coursework project that utilizes OpenAI Gymnasium's standard API and a diverse collection of reference environments to train agents through reinforcement learning. The project is written in Python and is suitable for use in educational and research settings.

## üìö About OpenAI Gymnasium

OpenAI Gymnasium is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a standard API for interacting with a variety of environments, including classic games, robotics, and Atari games. Gymnasium also includes a wide range of reference environments that can be used to benchmark algorithms and measure progress.

## üéì CourseWork Project

This coursework project is designed to provide hands-on experience with reinforcement learning techniques using the OpenAI Gymnasium toolkit. The project includes a variety of reference environments, including classic control problems such as the CartPole and MountainCar environments, as well as more complex problems such as the Atari games.

To complete the coursework project, students will be required to train agents using a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-learning, SARSA, and deep reinforcement learning approaches such as DQN and A3C. Students will also be required to evaluate the performance of their agents using standard metrics such as average reward, episode length, and time to convergence.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can then clone the project from GitHub and install the required dependencies using pip.

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/RL-CourseWork.git
cd RL-CourseWork
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project using the command:

```
python main.py
```

This will launch the main script, which will train and evaluate the agents using the specified reinforcement learning algorithms and environments.

## üìù Conclusion

This reinforcement learning coursework project provides a practical introduction to the OpenAI Gymnasium toolkit and the use of reinforcement learning techniques to solve complex problems. Through hands-on experience with a variety of reference environments and algorithms, students will gain valuable experience in developing and evaluating agents using reinforcement learning.

# 🤖 RL_GroupWork

This project is focused on using the [OpenAI Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/#)  (Gymnasium) to develop and experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms in a group setting. We will be working with the standard Gym API and its diverse collection of reference environments, all in Python! 🐍

## Introduction 🎉

In this project, our group will explore various reinforcement learning algorithms and techniques by leveraging the power of OpenAI Gym. Gym is a widely-used toolkit that provides a standard API for developing and comparing reinforcement learning agents. By using Gym, we can focus on designing and implementing innovative algorithms while gaining insights into their performance across a range of environments. 🚀
## Getting Started ⚙️

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites 📋

To get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Git
### Installation 🛠️ 
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mopokle/RL_GroupWork.git
``` 
2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd RL_GroupWork
``` 
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
